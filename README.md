# Nyra
Nyra model by Paul Tosca adapted for Urho3D engine.

Original model could be found at http://www.paultosca.com/newSite/nyra.html

Here is what Paul says:

20k tris low poly 
1x4096 textures( diffuse/normal/specular) 

I am giving away some source files for this character ... mainly with the idea to help others that might be on the road to becoming game character artists and want to check out the model/textures/psd layout and what not ... but do with them as you wish.
